Codingal is on a mission to inspire school kids and make them fall in love with coding.
Coding helps develop logical thinking, and problem-solving skills.
Coding jobs are the future.
They already constitute more than 60% of of all jobs in science, technology, engineering, and maths.
While those who start school, those who start young will be ahead of everyone by the time they are in college.
They will be the creators of our future.
